My Sublime Text Theme
====================

Based off of Tomorrow Night - Bright by Chris Kempson: https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme

Major changes are:
- punctuation is for the most part all the same color, including quotes
- the $variable prefix is a slightly different color from the variable name
- gitgutter styling
- lighter background
